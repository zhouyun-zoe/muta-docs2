title: Before We Start the Tutorial
---

In this tutorial, you will learn to compile and run a Muta chain with default configuration, and interact with it using a client tool. We will not be going into depth about the intricacies of developing on Muta, but will hopefully satisfy your curiosity so that you will continue this journey. This tutorial should take you about 1 hour to complete.

**This tutorial doesnâ€™t assume any existing Muta knowledge.** We only expect that:
* You are generally familiar with software development and using the terminal.
* You are generally familiar with blockchains and smart contract platforms.

Before we even get started, let's lay out what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial. We will:

1. Set up your computer to be able to develop on Muta.
2. Compile and start running Muta with default configuration right away.
3. Use the client tool to interact with our blockchain, and try to transfer tokens between user accounts.
