## Discord

[Muta Discord](https://discord.gg/rN35fe8) is the most responsive place to ask code-level questions or if you're stuck with a specific error. Search through the existing questions and answers in channel history or ask your own!

## Discussion forums

[Nervos forums](https://talk.nervos.org/) are a great place for discussion about best practices and architecture design as well as the future of Muta. If you have an answerable code-level question, discord is usually a better fit.
